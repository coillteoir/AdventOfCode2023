# Advent of Code 2023

I will be discussing my thoughts on each language I use in this challenge.

The main objective I had with this pool of languages was to have both familiar and unfamiliar languages,
mainly so I can challenge myself both in the sense of the problems submitted but also by twisting my brain to work with different styles of programming like forth, haskell, rust, and fortran.
